# File copier automation

When I migrated all the photos from my iPhone to my PC, photos were stored in like "weekly directories" that contained all the photos that I stored in the wheek. That setup resulted in having +500 folders with about 20 photos each. 

I wanted to have all the photos in one single folder, having in mind that copy and pasting each folder individually would take me a while, I decided to build a little program in Java that does that job for me. 

Copier class has a method that giving a directory, loops over all the folders and for each folder loops over all the files and copies those file on another destiny directory.
